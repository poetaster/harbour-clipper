- all the basics: trim, cut, pad, resize, speed
- add overlays: video, image, label or audio
- create storylines, slideshows, thumbnails
- create subtitles or add from file
- create splitscreen videos
- add transparency "greenscreens"
- extract audio files or mix in new tracks
- record audio as overlay comment
- apply effects or color filters
- re-encode files...
