Videoworks is an experimental new video editor for SailfishOS.

It is part of an initiative to provide some powerful multimedia tools in line with Imageworks and Audiocut. Among its features are:

- all the basics: trim, cut, pad, resize, speed
- add overlays: video, image, label or audio
- create storylines, slideshows, thumbnails
- create subtitles or add from file
- create splitscreen videos
- add transparency "greenscreens"
- extract audio files or mix in new tracks
- record audio as overlay comment
- apply effects or color filters
- re-encode files...
